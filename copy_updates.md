# SITE_COPY_V4 — Doppler/Edward Website Copy (Implement Verbatim)
Date: 2026-02-18
Rule: Keep existing layout and section structure. Replace copy only. Use “we.”

CTA standard:
- Replace “Email us” CTA label with: “Book a 30-minute diagnostic call”
- Link: mailto:sysop@doppleredward.com?subject=30-minute%20Diagnostic%20Call

NAV:
- Keep all existing nav items.
- Add Blog link: /blog.html (after RGM/TPM)
- Create missing /work.html (nav currently points there and it is broken)

### <title>
Doppler/Edward — Commercial Execution Systems Advisory

### <meta name="description">
Executive advisory for commercial execution systems in ERP-centric environments: RGM/TPM/TPx, trade governance, margin integrity, and end-to-end commercial finance systems.

### OG description (og:description)
Executive advisory for commercial execution systems: trade governance, margin integrity, and ERP-adjacent RGM/TPM/TPx.

## Home Hero (keep structure; update copy only)

### H1 (replace existing)
Commercial Execution Systems.<br><span class="mono">Economic integrity, end-to-end.</span>

### Lead paragraph (replace existing)
We help CPG and consumer businesses stabilize commercial execution stacks in ERP-centric environments — RGM/TPM/TPx, trade spend, pricing, and revenue planning — so trade and margin outcomes become economically predictable.

### Specialty line (replace existing)
Specialty: Trade Governance & Margin Integrity — contract-to-system alignment, accrual discipline, settlement controls, and channel integrity enforced through operating model and (when needed) contract.

### Add ONE additional short line beneath specialty-line (new p, not a new section)
We are SAP-adjacent: we validate the commercial logic, governance, and data flows ERP-centric stacks depend on — not generic ERP implementation.

### Hero Buttons (keep layout)
- “See our work” stays but ensure /work.html exists.
- Replace the email button text from “sysop@doppleredward.com” to: “Book a 30-minute diagnostic call”
- Link to the standard mailto with subject line.

## CORE CAPABILITIES section (keep the grid; tighten to 4 cards; preserve styling)

### Card 01 (keep title “Rescue & Triage”; replace paragraph + bullets)
Paragraph:
Post go-live stabilization for commercial platforms. We isolate failure points fast and restore workflow reality — without turning month-end into a negotiation.

Bullets:
- Root-cause isolation (data → logic → workflow)
- Vendor accountability (high/critical issues)
- Stabilization plan and execution cadence

### Card 02 (rename title from “Finance Systems & Planning” to “Commercial Finance Systems”)
Paragraph:
End-to-end commercial finance systems validation: trade execution → ERP postings → FP&A forecasts. We make the economic story consistent across systems.

Bullets:
- Integration and posting logic validation
- Forecasting alignment with execution reality
- Controls, auditability, and decision rights

### Card 03 (rename title from “Pragmatic AI” to “System Interrogation at Scale”)
Paragraph:
We use automation and AI internally to accelerate analysis — contract parsing, exception detection, and variance triage — with documented logic and clear audit trails.

Bullets:
- Contract-to-system mapping support
- Exception detection and sampling
- Documented methods, not black boxes

### Card 04 (keep title “Trade Governance Architecture”; tighten paragraph + bullets)
Paragraph:
The enforceable operating layer behind RGM: trade spend governance, accrual discipline, settlement controls, and channel integrity.

Bullets (tighten list; remove jargon-heavy phrasing):
- Trade spend governance (funding logic, accrual rules, dispute windows)
- Pricing and promotion integrity (approved intent vs configured logic)
- Settlement discipline (claims, deductions, compliance economics)
- Channel integrity (anti-diversion, accountability, enforceable consequences)

## EDUCATIONAL & LAB WORK section (keep structure; reduce “random app” vibe)

### Project 1 Title (rename “API Call Package” to “Applied Systems Demos”)
Copy:
Small, concrete demos used to teach and validate commercial systems logic — examples that make process design measurable.

Meta:
RGM • FP&A • Data Flows

### Project 2 Title (keep “Revenue Planning & CFO Simulator” or rename to “Commercial Execution Simulator” if preferred)
Copy:
Simulation tools that compress learning: planning vs execution reality, incentives, governance, and financial outcomes.

Meta:
Decision rights • Controls • Execution reality

### Project 3 Title (rename “Ad-Hoc Assignments” to “Field Work”)
Copy:
Targeted analyses and rapid diagnostics for teams who need the truth quickly — and need it to tie to real postings and outcomes.

Meta:
Diagnostics • Stabilization • Governance

## Footer
- Replace footer sentence “process-first consulting.” with:
  “commercial execution systems advisory.”
- Ensure CTA link exists in footer links if there’s room (optional). Keep ANSI footer art as-is.

## work.html (NEW — required; keep site style)
H1:
Work

Intro:
Commercial execution is a system of systems — contracts, workflows, data flows, and incentives. We stabilize commercial execution platforms and enforce economic integrity so outcomes show up in the P&L and balance sheet without theatrics.

Include this canonical one-liner:
Because system integrators configure software — we validate that commercial contracts, system logic, and financial outcomes are economically aligned.

Include SAP-adjacent clarifier:
We are SAP-adjacent: we validate the commercial logic, governance, and data flows ERP-centric stacks depend on — not generic ERP implementation.

Add three service blocks (short, scannable; match existing card styles if possible):
1) Deployment Rescue & Post-Go-Live Stabilization
2) Trade Governance & Margin Integrity (Retainer)
3) End-to-End Commercial Finance Systems Validation

End CTA:
Book a 30-minute diagnostic call (standard mailto)

---

## blog.html (NEW — keep minimal)
H1:
Blog

Intro:
Essays and field notes on commercial execution systems — written for people running trade spend, pricing, and planning inside ERP-centric reality.

Add 3 placeholder post cards:
1) The Allowance Shock Test: a CFO’s early warning signal
2) List price is fiction: the waterfall is reality
3) Post go-live is where the truth begins

End CTA:
Book a 30-minute diagnostic call (standard mailto)

## rgm.html
Keep page theme. Add a short intro at top:
We write about Revenue Growth Management as part of a larger commercial execution system — where contracts, execution, and finance must tell the same story.

Add a link to Blog: /blog.html

---

## about.html
Add/ensure SAP-adjacent clarifier exists.
Shift language to “we” consistently if any “I” appears.

---

## advocacy.html and team.html (ANSI)
Keep layout. Add one short bridge paragraph at top if not present:
Advocacy: systems shape outcomes; our work focuses on governance and economic integrity.
ANSI: craft matters; this is a nod to early digital culture; not a services page.
