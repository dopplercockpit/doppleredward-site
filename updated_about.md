About Doppler/Edward

Doppler/Edward is an executive systems and training partner focused on one outcome: making complex revenue and financial systems actually work for the people and businesses using them.

We sit at the intersection of Finance, Commercial, and Technology – where trade spend, pricing, and forecasting collide with ERP, TPM, and “AI” platforms. Our role is to own the end-to-end system: operating model, data, workflows, and governance. If the tools are in place but value isn’t showing up in the P&L, that’s where Doppler/Edward steps in.

What we believe

Systems must follow the operating model – not the other way around.
Technology should encode a clear way of working, not dictate it.

RGM is full-stack and closed-loop.
Planning, optimization, execution, settlement, and supply chain must be wired together, or value leaks.

AI is narrow, pragmatic, and agentic.
Generative AI is useful when it removes specific friction (data cleanup, analysis, decision support) – not when it’s sold as “transformation.”

Most “digital transformations” fail in the process layer.
Teams are not enabled, workflows aren’t rebuilt for digital, and incentives don’t match the new reality.

Measurement and governance beat dashboards and theater.
Clear KPIs, controls, and decision rights matter more than another visualization layer.

Leadership

Joshua Dopkowski
Founder & Executive RGM / FP&A Advisor

Joshua works with boards, Private Equity, CEOs, CFOs, and commercial leaders to turn RGM and financial systems into real levers of enterprise value, not just expensive infrastructure.

He brings international experience in program leadership, systems integration, and change management across FP&A and Revenue Growth Management, with a focus on CPG/FMCG and B2B SaaS. His work spans ERP→Cloud migrations, financial process automation, and cross-functional enablement for Finance, GTM, and IT teams. He has led pan-EU deployments and post-go-live rescue missions for major clients where RGM and trade investments were underperforming the business case.
