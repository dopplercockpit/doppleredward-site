Revenue Growth Management (RGM)

Who we are

Doppler/Edward is an executive RGM authority that sits at the intersection of Finance, Commercial, and Technology – and takes responsibility for whether Revenue Growth Management actually creates enterprise value.
Most RGM programs don’t fail because the software is bad. They fail because the business model, process, and incentives around that software are broken. In our experience, the majority of large RGM deployments never deliver the ROI sold in the business case – not because the vendor can’t code, but because nobody owns the end-to-end RGM system.
Doppler/Edward exists to own that system.
We close the gap between glossy solutions and ugly business reality. We don’t “implement & deploy”; we:
•	Rescue broken RGM workflows.
•	Align warring Finance and Sales/Category teams.
•	Turn tools like XTEL, Visualfabriq, SAP, and UpClear into actual levers of revenue and margin – not expensive reporting machines.

For boards and sponsors, the question is simple: Is RGM compounding enterprise value or quietly leaking it?
Our work makes that visible – and then fixable.

The Full-Stack RGM Cycle
We reject the idea that Trade Promotion Management is a self-contained project. True RGM is a continuous, closed-loop system that connects strategy, execution, and financial outcomes.
Doppler/Edward operates across the full merchandising and commercial cycle:
•	Strategy & Planning (TPM):
Moving from “roll forward last year’s plan” to zero-based, invest-for-growth planning. Linking promo calendars to P&L, brand objectives, and retailer strategy – not just to volume gaps.
•	Optimization (TPO / TSO):
Using predictive models (AI where it actually helps) to test lift, cannibalization, and margin impact before money is committed. No more “spray, pray, and post-rationalize.”
•	Execution & Settlement:
Industrializing the “unsexy” work – claims, deductions, settlement – so Sales can sell instead of reconciling spreadsheets. Reducing leakage, write-offs, and disputes that silently erode margin.
•	Supply Chain Integration:
Connecting the “One Number” forecast so commercial decisions actually talk to logistics, production, and warehousing. No more phantom promotions with no stock, or panic production that destroys working capital.
RGM only works when all four loops are wired together. That’s the operating model we design, fix, and govern.

The AI Thesis: Narrow, Pragmatic, Agentic
Doppler/Edward does not chase “AI transformation.” We deploy narrow, edge AI to remove specific, painful friction that is blocking RGM from working.
Two places we focus:
•	Data Rationalization:
Using AI to clean, reconcile, and “mash up” messy ERP, POS, and syndicated data before it enters the TPM/TPO stack. This is where most RGM projects silently die: bad hierarchies, bad mapping, and no trust. We fix that.
•	Workflow Agents (“RGM Co-Pilots”):
Giving Sales Directors, Revenue Managers, and Finance Partners a conversational layer on top of their tools:
“What happens to my trade spend and margin if I run a BOGO in Week 40 at Retailer X?”
Instead of 50 clicks across five screens, they get one answer with assumptions clearly exposed.
The goal is not “cool AI demos.” The goal is:
•	Better decisions, made faster.
•	Fewer promo disasters.
•	Higher confidence in the numbers driving the board pack.

For Boards & Private Equity: Functional Due Diligence
When evaluating RGM platforms – whether for acquisition, turnaround, or large-scale rollout – source-code and architecture reviews are necessary, but not sufficient.
You need Functional Due Diligence: a hard look at whether the platform’s commercial and financial logic will survive contact with a Tier 1 CPG reality.
Doppler/Edward answers the questions technical and financial auditors usually miss:
•	Commercial Reality Check:
Does the promo, pricing, and funding logic actually hold up in complex, multi-banner, multi-market retail environments? Or does it assume a fantasy world where data is clean and retailers behave?
•	AI Truth Test:
Is the “AI” genuinely predictive and explainable – or just a glorified regression wrapped in marketing language? Can the business actually challenge and govern the models?
•	Process Survival:
Will this platform survive the Process Gap of a global CPG client – fragmented data, local exceptions, competing incentives – or will it quietly stall and churn in Year 2?
For boards and PE sponsors, Doppler/Edward acts as:
•	An independent RGM lens on deals and large programs.
•	A safeguard against expensive “RGM transformations” that never touch the real drivers of value.
•	A design partner for operating models where RGM is not a project, but a permanent capability.
