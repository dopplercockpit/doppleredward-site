[HERO]
OPERATIONAL INTERVENTION
We do not deliver slide decks. We deploy systems, rescue failing commercial architectures, and govern the collision between RGM software and business reality.

SECTION 1 – CORE CAPABILITIES
(The “What”)
Reframed from services to Interventions.

01 // RESCUE & REMEDIATION
Status: ACTIVE
Most SaaS deployments fail because they ignore the human workflow and the real operating model.
We deploy as a fractional Chief RGM / FP&A authority to triage broken implementations. We audit configuration, interrogate data flows, and force alignment between Finance, Sales, and IT.
Then we re-engineer the end-to-end process until the tool actually delivers the ROI that was promised in the board deck.
Typical triggers:
•	TPM/RGM project stuck in “pilot” or perpetual hypercare
•	Low adoption, conflicting numbers, or firefights before business reviews
•	Trade spend, deductions, and “Gross-to-Net” leakage nobody can fully explain
________________________________________
02 // FUNCTIONAL DEPLOYMENT
Status: ACTIVE
System integrators know the code. We know the trade desk, the P&L, and the retailer reality.
We sit on the client side during global rollouts, managing the unsexy but critical work: Price Pack Architecture, Gross-to-Net settlement, funding logic, and UAT pre-flight checks.
Our job is to ensure the software survives contact with the market and with your internal politics – not just that it passes a technical go-live.
Typical triggers:
•	Multi-country TPM / Demand Planning rollout (EMEA, NA, LATAM, etc.)
•	Need for a “single truth” across Sales, Finance, and Supply Chain
•	Fear that the tool will revert to offline Excel the minute the SI leaves
________________________________________
03 // VENDOR INTERROGATION
Status: ACTIVE
We run bare-knuckle fit–gap assessments for boards, CFOs, and PE sponsors.
Before you commit to a multi-million-dollar platform, we interrogate the functional limits of tools like Visualfabriq, SAP, UpClear, and others – from the standpoint of RGM, Finance, and trade operations, not just architecture.
We separate genuine predictive capability from marketing theater, and we stress-test whether the platform can survive your data, your retailers, and your internal process gap.
Typical triggers:
•	RFP shortlists where the slideware all looks the same
•	PE or corporate DD evaluating an RGM/TPM asset
•	Concern that “AI” claims are just regression models wrapped in buzzwords

SECTION 2 – MISSION LOGS
(The “Proof”)
Representative missions drawn from real deployments. Names and details are simplified; the outcomes are not.
________________________________________
LOG_001: MARGIN RECOVERY & AUTOMATION
Target: Global Beauty & CPG Enterprise (≈$394M business unit)
Vector: Finance Transformation / FP&A
Action:
•	Deployed automated workflows for claims and promotional finance
•	Re-engineered the Gross-to-Net settlement process to close leakage
•	Rationalized promo reporting so Finance and Sales finally saw the same movie
Result:
Recovered 330+ basis points of margin and streamlined GTM decision-making around promo, pricing, and funding.
________________________________________
LOG_002: GLOBAL RGM ROLLOUT
Target: Leading RGM SaaS Vendor / Tier 1 CPG Clients
Vector: Multi-country deployment (EMEA & North America)
Action:
•	Directed TPM and demand-planning deployments across 10+ markets
•	Built the “rescue playbook” for stalled projects and mismatched expectations
•	Aligned executive stakeholders before code was touched, reducing scope churn
Result:
Stabilized adoption, reduced project drift, and created a repeatable model for cross-border RGM rollouts.
________________________________________
LOG_003: AI & WORKFLOW ENGINEERING
Target: CPG Planning & Finance Teams
Vector: GenAI & workflow prototyping
Action:
•	Designed lightweight GenAI agents to “mash up” messy ERP and syndicated data
•	Automated ingestion into planning tools and eliminated manual glue work
•	Enabled Sales and Finance leaders to query trade performance in natural language instead of navigating complex dashboards
Result:
Reduced “garbage in” failure modes and accelerated decision cycles for trade investments and promo evaluations.

SECTION 3 – ENGAGEMENT PARAMETERS
(The Call to Action)
INITIATE SEQUENCE
We operate with a capped client roster to ensure principal-level involvement in every intervention. No anonymous bench, no offshored black box.
Choose the engagement mode that fits your level of urgency and exposure:
•	[ ADVISORY RETAINER ]
Ongoing governance, board-level challenge, and “Co-Pilot” leadership for RGM, FP&A, and AI-enabled workflows.
•	[ PROJECT SPRINT ]
Focused interventions for specific rescues, audits, or deployments (typically 3–9 months), with clear exit criteria and success metrics.
•	[ DUE DILIGENCE ]
Fixed-fee Functional Due Diligence for Board / PE acquisitions and major platform decisions.

Design notes (notes for the designer).
Keeping in line with now implemented style points of the rest of the site, please place a focus on:
•	Page title / H1: “Operational Intervention”
•	Capability blocks: Treat “01 // RESCUE & REMEDIATION” etc. as monospaced headings (<code> style or font-family: 'Roboto Mono', monospace).
•	Mission logs:
o	Prefix with LOG_001, LOG_002, etc., styled like terminal entries.
o	Use a subtle accent (amber/orange) on key metrics: 330+ bps, 10+ markets, etc…
•	Dividers: Keep in line with site style
If you can:
•	Draft a lightweight one-paragraph intro for each log that be used as hover text / modal content if and make them expandable.
