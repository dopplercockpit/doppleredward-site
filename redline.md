1. Layout Concept – “Sysop Product Teaser”
Think of the page as a product dossier in a terminal, not a shower of marketing confetti.
Overall structure:
1.	Hero block: Name + one-line definition + “Status: IN DEVELOPMENT”.
2.	Section A – What Redline Is: Short narrative, 2–3 tight paragraphs.
3.	Section B – Core Systems (Modules): 3 “panels” for major components.
4.	Section C – Use Cases: Who it’s for and where it fits.
5.	Section D – Build Log / Roadmap: A few LOG_00X entries for progress + future.
6.	Section E – CTA: “Request a demo / Pilot / Investor discussion.”
Visual / layout ideas (for your dev):
•	Use the same monospace headers as Work page (“LOG_001”, “MODULE_01”) for sections.
•	Give “modules” a terminal window look: thin border, small title bar text like MODULE_01: DECISION ENGINE.
•	Use accent color (your orange) for metrics, statuses, and labels (STATUS: ALPHA, SCENARIOS: 12+).
•	Between sections, reuse those strict horizontal dividers to keep the industrial, sysop feel.

You can keep or drop the “Simulator Engine” subtitle depending on how nerdy you want it.

REDLINE
Simulation engine for finance decisions under real constraints.
Subhead:
An interactive CFO office where students, managers, and executives learn to push a business to the edge—without detonating the P&L in real life.

SECTION A – WHAT REDLINE IS
What is Redline?
Redline is a simulation engine that teaches financial decision-making, not spreadsheet key-mashing.
Set inside a fictional industrial company, Redline drops players into a live CFO office:
inventory, capacity, working capital, customer contracts, and a board breathing down their necks. No multiple-choice fantasies—every move flows through full financial statements and a real operating model.
Participants don’t “learn concepts.” They run a business under pressure:
•	Pricing, discounting, and trade terms
•	Volume risk, supply chain shocks, and production constraints
•	Cash flow crunches, credit risk, and audit scrutiny
Redline is built for the people who actually have to answer, “Why did we miss?”—and for the educators and leaders who want them to miss less.

SECTION B – CORE SYSTEMS
Header:
Core Systems
Subhead:
Three integrated systems, one objective: teach the real cost of every decision.
________________________________________
MODULE_01 // DECISION ENGINE
STATUS: LIVE PROTOTYPE
The in-game company has a full financial backbone:
•	Income Statement, Balance Sheet, Cash Flow
•	Inventory and production capacity
•	Customer and contract portfolio
Every decision (pricing, promo, volume commitments, supplier terms) drives real financial consequences—good, bad, or ugly. No abstract “score,” just the numbers you’d have to explain in a board pack.
________________________________________
MODULE_02 // SCENARIO & TELEMETRY LAYER
STATUS: LIVE PROTOTYPE
Redline runs as a sequence of scenarios—supply shocks, demand spikes, cost increases, contract renegotiations.
Under the hood, a telemetry engine tracks:
•	Choices made (what, when, and in what order)
•	Impact on margin, liquidity, and risk
•	Time-to-decision and information used
This creates a decision fingerprint for each participant or team, making it easy to debrief: not just what they decided, but how they thought.
________________________________________
MODULE_03 // LLM-ASSISTED DYNAMICS
STATUS: EXPERIMENTAL
Redline uses a controlled GenAI layer to add semi-dynamic content:
•	News feeds that surface shocks and opportunities
•	Supplier and customer “emails” and draft contracts
•	Nudges and challenge prompts that stress-test the player’s reasoning
The AI does not run the show; it adds noise and realism. The financial logic and scoring remain fully transparent and auditable.
________________________________________
SECTION C – USE CASES
Header:
Where Redline Fits
Subhead:
Built for serious training environments where role-play isn’t enough and Excel isn’t engaging.
________________________________________
UNIVERSITIES & BUSINESS SCHOOLS
•	Courses in Finance, FP&A, Strategy, Accounting, Operations, and RGM
•	Replace static case studies with live, multi-period simulations
•	Give students something more realistic than a clean Harvard case and a retrofitted answer key
CORPORATE FP&A, RGM & FINANCE ACADEMIES
•	Onboard new analysts and managers with a safe sandbox
•	Run team-based war games ahead of budget season or major investments
•	Train cross-functional teams (Finance, Sales, Supply Chain) to speak the same P&L language
PRIVATE EQUITY & INVESTORS
•	Use Redline as a tabletop for management teams: how do they react under real constraints?
•	Stress-test pricing, capacity, and capital allocation instincts before handing over real money

SECTION D – BUILD LOG / ROADMAP
Header:
Build Log
Subhead:
Representative milestones from the current build. Names simplified; structure is real.
________________________________________
BUILD_LOG_001 // CFO OFFICE PROTOTYPE
STATUS: COMPLETE
•	Godot 4.5-based simulation with an interactive CFO office
•	Hotspots for financials, news, contracts, and compendium content
•	Dynamic financial panel wired to scenario data (top line, margin, cash)
________________________________________
BUILD_LOG_002 // SCENARIO ENGINE & DATA LAYER
STATUS: COMPLETE
•	JSON-driven scenario structure (12+ scenarios planned)
•	Each scenario ties to: financials, news, supplier contracts, and risk levers
•	Transform layer ready for “carry-forward” cumulative financials
________________________________________
BUILD_LOG_003 // CONTRACT & NEWS GENERATION
STATUS: IN PROGRESS
•	Supplier framework contract templates with variable injection
•	API concept for LLM-generated clause variations and news items under strict schema
•	Goal: 70% structured, 30% dynamic—no black-box magic
________________________________________
BUILD_LOG_004 // TELEMETRY & ADMIN TOOLS
STATUS: PLANNED
•	Telemetry singleton to log decisions, timing, panel views, and submissions
•	Google Sheets / DB integration for instructor dashboards
•	Admin mode to jump scenarios, pause logging, and control difficulty

SECTION E – CTA / ENGAGEMENT
Header:
Initiate Redline
Subhead:
We’re actively building Redline with a small set of partners. If you run a program where financial decisions matter, we should talk.
