# Doppler/Edward Site Revisions — Copy Restructure

**Goal:** Collapse to 3 canonical pillars, eliminate cross-page redundancy, keep layout/CSS untouched.

**Canonical pillar names (exact, used everywhere):**
1. ERP-Centric Commercial Execution
2. RGM / TPM / TPO / TPx
3. End-to-End Commercial Finance Systems
