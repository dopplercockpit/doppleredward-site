      <h2>WHO WE ARE</h2>

    </div>



    <p class="manifesto">Doppler/Edward is an executive RGM authority that sits at the intersection of Finance, Commercial, and Technology &mdash; and takes responsibility for whether Revenue Growth Management actually creates enterprise value.</p>



    <p>Most RGM programs don't fail because the software is bad. They fail because the business model, process, and incentives around that software are broken. In our experience, the majority of large RGM deployments never deliver the ROI sold in the business case &mdash; not because the vendor can't code, but because nobody owns the end-to-end RGM system.</p>



    <p>Doppler/Edward exists to own that system.</p>



    <p>We close the gap between glossy solutions and ugly business reality. We don't "implement & deploy"; we:</p>

    <div class="capability-grid">

      <div class="capability-card">Rescue broken RGM workflows.</div>

      <div class="capability-card">Align warring Finance and Sales/Category teams.</div>

      <div class="capability-card">Turn tools like XTEL, Visualfabriq, SAP, and UpClear into actual levers of revenue and margin &mdash; not expensive reporting machines.</div>

    </div>



    <p class="key-question">For boards and sponsors, the question is simple: Is RGM compounding enterprise value or quietly leaking it?</p>

    <p class="key-answer">Our work makes that visible &mdash; and then fixable.</p>

      <h2>THE FULL-STACK RGM CYCLE</h2>

    </div>



    <p>We reject the idea that Trade Promotion Management is a self-contained project. True RGM is a continuous, closed-loop system that connects strategy, execution, and financial outcomes.</p>



    <p>Doppler/Edward operates across the full merchandising and commercial cycle:</p>



    <div class="rgm-cycle-grid">

      <div class="cycle-card">

        <div class="cycle-number">01</div>

        <h3>Strategy & Planning (TPM)</h3>

        <p>Moving from "roll forward last year's plan" to zero-based, invest-for-growth planning. Linking promo calendars to P&L, brand objectives, and retailer strategy &mdash; not just to volume gaps.</p>

        <div class="connector connector-right"></div>

      </div>



      <div class="cycle-card">

        <div class="cycle-number">02</div>

        <h3>Optimization (TPO / TSO)</h3>

        <p>Using predictive models (AI where it actually helps) to test lift, cannibalization, and margin impact before money is committed. No more "spray, pray, and post-rationalize."</p>

        <div class="connector connector-down"></div>

      </div>



      <div class="cycle-card">

        <div class="cycle-number">03</div>

        <h3>Execution & Settlement</h3>

        <p>Industrializing the "unsexy" work &mdash; claims, deductions, settlement &mdash; so Sales can sell instead of reconciling spreadsheets. Reducing leakage, write-offs, and disputes that silently erode margin.</p>

        <div class="connector connector-left"></div>

      </div>



      <div class="cycle-card">

        <div class="cycle-number">04</div>

        <h3>Supply Chain Integration</h3>

        <p>Connecting the "One Number" forecast so commercial decisions actually talk to logistics, production, and warehousing. No more phantom promotions with no stock, or panic production that destroys working capital.</p>

        <div class="connector connector-up"></div>

      </div>

    </div>



    <p class="cycle-conclusion">RGM only works when all four loops are wired together. That's the operating model we design, fix, and govern.</p>

      <h2>THE AI THESIS: NARROW, PRAGMATIC, AGENTIC</h2>

    </div>



    <p>Doppler/Edward does not chase "AI transformation." We deploy narrow, edge AI to remove specific, painful friction that is blocking RGM from working.</p>



    <p class="focus-intro">Two places we focus:</p>



    <div class="ai-focus-grid">

      <div class="ai-card">

        <h3>Data Rationalization</h3>

        <p>Using AI to clean, reconcile, and "mash up" messy ERP, POS, and syndicated data before it enters the TPM/TPO stack. This is where most RGM projects silently die: bad hierarchies, bad mapping, and no trust. We fix that.</p>

      </div>



      <div class="ai-card">

        <h3>Workflow Agents ("RGM Co-Pilots")</h3>

        <p>Giving Sales Directors, Revenue Managers, and Finance Partners a conversational layer on top of their tools:</p>

        <div class="terminal-query">

          <span class="prompt">></span> What happens to my trade spend and margin if I run a BOGO in Week 40 at Retailer X?

        </div>

        <p>Instead of 50 clicks across five screens, they get one answer with assumptions clearly exposed.</p>

      </div>

    </div>



    <p class="goal-intro">The goal is not "cool AI demos." The goal is:</p>

    <div class="goal-checklist">

      <div class="check-item"><span class="check">&check;</span> Better decisions, made faster.</div>

      <div class="check-item"><span class="check">&check;</span> Fewer promo disasters.</div>

      <div class="check-item"><span class="check">&check;</span> Higher confidence in the numbers driving the board pack.</div>

      <h2>FOR BOARDS & PRIVATE EQUITY: FUNCTIONAL DUE DILIGENCE</h2>

    </div>



    <p>When evaluating RGM platforms &mdash; whether for acquisition, turnaround, or large-scale rollout &mdash; source-code and architecture reviews are necessary, but not sufficient.</p>



    <p class="dd-emphasis">You need Functional Due Diligence: a hard look at whether the platform's commercial and financial logic will survive contact with a Tier 1 CPG reality.</p>



    <p>Doppler/Edward answers the questions technical and financial auditors usually miss:</p>



    <div class="dd-checklist">

      <div class="dd-item alert">

        <div class="dd-bracket">[ ]</div>

        <div class="dd-content">

          <h3>Commercial Reality Check</h3>

          <p>Does the promo, pricing, and funding logic actually hold up in complex, multi-banner, multi-market retail environments? Or does it assume a fantasy world where data is clean and retailers behave?</p>

        </div>

      </div>



      <div class="dd-item">

        <div class="dd-bracket">[ ]</div>

        <div class="dd-content">

          <h3>AI Truth Test</h3>

          <p>Is the "AI" genuinely predictive and explainable &mdash; or just a glorified regression wrapped in marketing language? Can the business actually challenge and govern the models?</p>

        </div>

      </div>



      <div class="dd-item alert">

        <div class="dd-bracket">[ ]</div>

        <div class="dd-content">

          <h3>Process Survival</h3>

          <p>Will this platform survive the Process Gap of a global CPG client &mdash; fragmented data, local exceptions, competing incentives &mdash; or will it quietly stall and churn in Year 2?</p>

        </div>

      </div>

    </div>



    <p class="pe-intro">For boards and PE sponsors, Doppler/Edward acts as:</p>

    <div class="pe-role-grid">

      <div class="pe-role">An independent RGM lens on deals and large programs.</div>

      <div class="pe-role">A safeguard against expensive "RGM transformations" that never touch the real drivers of value.</div>

      <div class="pe-role">A design partner for operating models where RGM is not a project, but a permanent capability.</div>
