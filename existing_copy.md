**H1:**
Commercial Execution Systems.
*Economic integrity, end-to-end.*

**Lead paragraph:**
We help CPG and consumer businesses stabilize commercial execution stacks in ERP-centric environments — RGM/TPM/TPx, trade spend, pricing, and revenue planning — so trade and margin outcomes become economically predictable.

**Specialty line:**
Specialty: Trade Governance & Margin Integrity — contract-to-system alignment, accrual discipline, settlement controls, and channel integrity enforced through operating model and (when needed) contract.

**SAP clarifier:**
We are SAP-adjacent: we validate the commercial logic, governance, and data flows ERP-centric stacks depend on — not generic ERP implementation.

### [001] CORE CAPABILITIES

**Card 01 — Rescue & Triage**
Post go-live stabilization for commercial platforms. We isolate failure points fast and restore workflow reality — without turning month-end into a negotiation.
- Root-cause isolation (data → logic → workflow)
- Vendor accountability (high/critical issues)
- Stabilization plan and execution cadence

**Card 02 — Commercial Finance Systems**
End-to-end commercial finance systems validation: trade execution → ERP postings → FP&A forecasts. We make the economic story consistent across systems.
- Integration and posting logic validation
- Forecasting alignment with execution reality
- Controls, auditability, and decision rights

**Card 03 — System Interrogation at Scale**
We use automation and AI internally to accelerate analysis — contract parsing, exception detection, and variance triage — with documented logic and clear audit trails.
- Contract-to-system mapping support
- Exception detection and sampling
- Documented methods, not black boxes

**Card 04 — Trade Governance Architecture**
The enforceable operating layer behind RGM: trade spend governance, accrual discipline, settlement controls, and channel integrity.
- Trade spend governance (funding logic, accrual rules, dispute windows)
- Pricing and promotion integrity (approved intent vs configured logic)
- Settlement discipline (claims, deductions, compliance economics)
- Channel integrity (anti-diversion, accountability, enforceable consequences)

**H1:** Work
**Subtitle:** COMMERCIAL EXECUTION SYSTEMS ADVISORY
**Intro:** Commercial execution is a system of systems — contracts, workflows, data flows, and incentives. We stabilize commercial execution platforms and enforce economic integrity so outcomes show up in the P&L and balance sheet without theatrics.

### Intro body
Because system integrators configure software — we validate that commercial contracts, system logic, and financial outcomes are economically aligned.

We are SAP-adjacent: we validate the commercial logic, governance, and data flows ERP-centric stacks depend on — not generic ERP implementation.

### [001] SERVICES

**Service 01 — Deployment Rescue & Post-Go-Live Stabilization**
We isolate failure points in commercial platforms after go-live and restore workflow reality fast — without turning month-end into a negotiation. Root-cause isolation, vendor accountability, and an executable stabilization plan.

**Service 02 — Trade Governance & Margin Integrity (Retainer)**
The enforceable operating layer behind RGM: trade spend governance, accrual discipline, settlement controls, and channel integrity — enforced through operating model and (when needed) contract. Ongoing retainer engagement.

**Service 03 — End-to-End Commercial Finance Systems Validation**
Trade execution → ERP postings → FP&A forecasts: we validate that the commercial logic, integration, and posting logic are consistent so the economic story holds across systems.

---

### [002] CORE CAPABILITIES

**01 — RESCUE & REMEDIATION** *(Status: Active)*
Most SaaS deployments fail because they ignore the human workflow and the real operating model.

We deploy as a fractional Chief RGM / FP&A authority to triage broken implementations. We audit configuration, interrogate data flows, and force alignment between Finance, Sales, and IT.

Then we re-engineer the end-to-end process until the tool actually delivers the ROI that was promised in the board deck.

*Typical triggers:*
- TPM/RGM project stuck in "pilot" or perpetual hypercare
- Low adoption, conflicting numbers, or firefights before business reviews
- Trade spend, deductions, and "Gross-to-Net" leakage nobody can fully explain

**02 — FUNCTIONAL DEPLOYMENT** *(Status: Active)*
System integrators know the code. We know the trade desk, the P&L, and the retailer reality.

We sit on the client side during global rollouts, managing the unsexy but critical work: Price Pack Architecture, Gross-to-Net settlement, funding logic, and UAT pre-flight checks.

Our job is to ensure the software survives contact with the market and with your internal politics — not just that it passes a technical go-live.

*Typical triggers:*
- Multi-country TPM / Demand Planning rollout (EMEA, NA, LATAM, etc.)
- Need for a "single truth" across Sales, Finance, and Supply Chain
- Fear that the tool will revert to offline Excel the minute the SI leaves

**03 — VENDOR INTERROGATION** *(Status: Active)*
We run bare-knuckle fit–gap assessments for boards, CFOs, and PE sponsors.

Before you commit to a multi-million-dollar platform, we interrogate the functional limits of tools like Visualfabriq, SAP, UpClear, and others — from the standpoint of RGM, Finance, and trade operations, not just architecture.

We separate genuine predictive capability from marketing theater, and we stress-test whether the platform can survive your data, your retailers, and your internal process gap.

*Typical triggers:*
- RFP shortlists where the slideware all looks the same
- PE or corporate DD evaluating an RGM/TPM asset
- Concern that "AI" claims are just regression models wrapped in buzzwords

---

### [003] TRADE GOVERNANCE (THE MISSING LAYER)

Most RGM programs fail because trade rules live in people's heads, email threads, and Excel files. We codify trade reality into enforceable commercial terms: who funds what, who absorbs inventory risk, how promotions settle, and what happens when execution fails. The result is a trade operating system, enforced by contract when needed. We pre-decided the economics so execution can't rewrite them, and built it to prevent promo accruals exploding in ERP systems.

Systems don't fix behavior -- economic consequences do. Trade integrity depends on consequences you can enforce.

- Trade spend governance: funding rules, accrual discipline, dispute windows
- Inventory lifecycle economics: excess/obsolete/discontinued accountability
- Routing + compliance enforcement: chargebacks, penalties, offsets (monetized non-compliance)
- Channel discipline: anti-diversion, channel conflict management, and controlled eligibility

### `<title>`
About — Doppler/Edward

### Hero
**H1:** About Doppler/Edward
**Subtitle:** EXECUTIVE SYSTEMS & TRAINING PARTNER

### Intro
Doppler/Edward is an executive systems and training partner focused on one outcome: making complex revenue and financial systems actually work for the people and businesses using them.

We sit at the intersection of Finance, Commercial, and Technology — where trade spend, pricing, and forecasting collide with ERP, TPM, and "AI" platforms. Our role is to own the end-to-end system: operating model, data, workflows, and governance. If the tools are in place but value isn't showing up in the P&L, that's where Doppler/Edward steps in.

We are SAP-adjacent: we validate the commercial logic, governance, and data flows ERP-centric stacks depend on — not generic ERP implementation.

---

### [001] WHAT WE BELIEVE

**Systems must follow the operating model — not the other way around.**
Technology should encode a clear way of working, not dictate it.

**RGM is full-stack and closed-loop.**
Planning, optimization, execution, settlement, and supply chain must be wired together, or value leaks.

**AI is narrow, pragmatic, and agentic.**
Generative AI is useful when it removes specific friction (data cleanup, analysis, decision support) — not when it's sold as "transformation."

**Most "digital transformations" fail in the process layer.**
Teams are not enabled, workflows aren't rebuilt for digital, and incentives don't match the new reality.

**Measurement and governance beat dashboards and theater.**
Clear KPIs, controls, and decision rights matter more than another visualization layer.

**Trade is a balance sheet problem, not a dashboard problem.**
If inventory economics, settlement logic, and channel discipline aren't governed, "insights" become theater.

---

### `<title>`
Revenue Growth Management — Doppler/Edward

### Hero
**H1:** Revenue Growth Management (RGM)
**Subtitle:** TACTICAL BRIEFING / EXECUTIVE TERMINAL

### Intro bridge (top of page content)
We write about Revenue Growth Management as part of a larger commercial execution system — where contracts, execution, and finance must tell the same story. Read more on the Blog.

---

### [001] WHO WE ARE

Doppler/Edward is an executive RGM authority that sits at the intersection of Finance, Commercial, and Technology — and takes responsibility for whether Revenue Growth Management actually creates enterprise value.

Most RGM programs don't fail because the software is bad. They fail because the business model, process, and incentives around that software are broken. In our experience, the majority of large RGM deployments never deliver the ROI sold in the business case — not because the vendor can't code, but because nobody owns the end-to-end RGM system.

Doppler/Edward exists to own that system.

We close the gap between glossy solutions and ugly business reality. We don't "implement & deploy"; we:
- Rescue broken RGM workflows.
- Align warring Finance and Sales/Category teams.
- Turn tools like XTEL, Visualfabriq, SAP, and UpClear into actual levers of revenue and margin — not expensive reporting machines.

For boards and sponsors, the question is simple: Is RGM compounding enterprise value or quietly leaking it?

Our work makes that visible — and then fixable.

*(divider)*

Proof: I've authored and operated distributor agreements that hard-code trade economics (promotions, inventory, routing, compliance) into enforceable rules.

---

### [002] THE FULL-STACK RGM CYCLE

We reject the idea that Trade Promotion Management is a self-contained project. True RGM is a continuous, closed-loop system that connects strategy, execution, and financial outcomes.

Doppler/Edward operates across the full merchandising and commercial cycle:

**01 — Strategy & Planning (TPM)**
Moving from "roll forward last year's plan" to zero-based, invest-for-growth planning. Linking promo calendars to P&L, brand objectives, and retailer strategy — not just to volume gaps.

**02 — Optimization (TPO / TSO)**
Using predictive models (AI where it actually helps) to test lift, cannibalization, and margin impact before money is committed. No more "spray, pray, and post-rationalize."

**03 — Execution & Settlement**
Industrializing the "unsexy" work — claims, deductions, settlement — so Sales can sell instead of reconciling spreadsheets. Reducing leakage, write-offs, and disputes that silently erode margin.

**04 — Supply Chain Integration**
Connecting the "One Number" forecast so commercial decisions actually talk to logistics, production, and warehousing. No more phantom promotions with no stock, or panic production that destroys working capital.

**05 — Trade Governance Architecture (Enforcement Layer)**
Strategy without enforcement becomes leakage. We build the trade operating system, enforced by contract when needed: channel rules, funding logic, inventory economics, and compliance consequences -- so RGM survives contact with reality.
- Trade spend governance (funding rules, accrual discipline, dispute windows)
- Balance-sheet aware trade (inventory risk allocation and lifecycle rules)
- Channel integrity (anti-diversion; channel conflict management)
- Monetized non-compliance (chargebacks and enforceable consequences)

RGM only works when all five loops are wired together. That's the operating model we design, fix, and govern.

---

### [003] THE AI THESIS: NARROW, PRAGMATIC, AGENTIC

Doppler/Edward does not chase "AI transformation." We deploy narrow, edge AI to remove specific, painful friction that is blocking RGM from working.

Two places we focus:

**Data Rationalization**
Using AI to clean, reconcile, and "mash up" messy ERP, POS, and syndicated data before it enters the TPM/TPO stack. This is where most RGM projects silently die: bad hierarchies, bad mapping, and no trust. We fix that.

**Workflow Agents ("RGM Co-Pilots")**
Giving Sales Directors, Revenue Managers, and Finance Partners a conversational layer on top of their tools:

> What happens to my trade spend and margin if I run a BOGO in Week 40 at Retailer X?

Instead of 50 clicks across five screens, they get one answer with assumptions clearly exposed.

The goal is not "cool AI demos." The goal is:
- Better decisions, made faster.
- Fewer promo disasters.
- Higher confidence in the numbers driving the board pack.

---

### [004] FOR BOARDS & PRIVATE EQUITY: FUNCTIONAL DUE DILIGENCE

When evaluating RGM platforms — whether for acquisition, turnaround, or large-scale rollout — source-code and architecture reviews are necessary, but not sufficient.

You need Functional Due Diligence: a hard look at whether the platform's commercial and financial logic will survive contact with a Tier 1 CPG reality.

Doppler/Edward answers the questions technical and financial auditors usually miss:

**[ ] Commercial Reality Check**
Does the promo, pricing, and funding logic actually hold up in complex, multi-banner, multi-market retail environments? Or does it assume a fantasy world where data is clean and retailers behave?

**[ ] AI Truth Test**
Is the "AI" genuinely predictive and explainable — or just a glorified regression wrapped in marketing language? Can the business actually challenge and govern the models?

**[ ] Process Survival**
Will this platform survive the Process Gap of a global CPG client — fragmented data, local exceptions, competing incentives — or will it quietly stall and churn in Year 2?

For boards and PE sponsors, Doppler/Edward acts as:
- An independent RGM lens on deals and large programs.
- A safeguard against expensive "RGM transformations" that never touch the real drivers of value.
- A design partner for operating models where RGM is not a project, but a permanent capability.

### [001] WHAT REDLINE IS

Redline is a simulation engine that teaches financial decision-making, not spreadsheet key-mashing.

Built by practitioners who've governed real pricing, discounting, and trade terms -- not just taught them.

Set inside a fictional industrial company, Redline drops players into a live CFO office: inventory, capacity, working capital, customer contracts, and a board breathing down their necks. No multiple-choice fantasies — every move flows through full financial statements and a real operating model.

Participants don't "learn concepts." They run a business under pressure:
- Pricing, discounting, and trade terms
- Volume risk, supply chain shocks, and production constraints
- Cash flow crunches, credit risk, and audit scrutiny

Redline is built for the people who actually have to answer, "Why did we miss?" and for the educators and leaders who want them to miss less.

---

### [002] CORE SYSTEMS

Three integrated systems, one objective: teach the real cost of every decision.

**MODULE_01 — DECISION ENGINE** *(Live Prototype)*
The in-game company has a full financial backbone:
- Income Statement, Balance Sheet, Cash Flow
- Inventory and production capacity
- Customer and contract portfolio

Every decision (pricing, promo, volume commitments, supplier terms) drives real financial consequences — good, bad, or ugly. No abstract "score," just the numbers you'd have to explain in a board pack.

**MODULE_02 — SCENARIO & TELEMETRY LAYER** *(Live Prototype)*
Redline runs as a sequence of scenarios — supply shocks, demand spikes, cost increases, contract renegotiations.

Under the hood, a telemetry engine tracks:
- Choices made (what, when, and in what order)
- Impact on margin, liquidity, and risk
- Time-to-decision and information used

This creates a decision fingerprint for each participant or team, making it easy to debrief: not just what they decided, but how they thought.

**MODULE_03 — LLM-ASSISTED DYNAMICS** *(Experimental)*
Redline uses a controlled GenAI layer to add semi-dynamic content:
- News feeds that surface shocks and opportunities
- Supplier and customer "emails" and draft contracts
- Nudges and challenge prompts that stress-test the player's reasoning

The AI does not run the show; it adds noise and realism. The financial logic and scoring remain fully transparent and auditable.

---

### [003] WHERE REDLINE FITS

Built for serious training environments where role-play isn't enough and Excel isn't engaging.

**UNIVERSITIES & BUSINESS SCHOOLS**
- Courses in Finance, FP&A, Strategy, Accounting, Operations, and RGM
- Replace static case studies with live, multi-period simulations
- Give students something more realistic than a clean Harvard case and a retrofitted answer key

**CORPORATE FP&A, RGM & FINANCE ACADEMIES**
- Onboard new analysts and managers with a safe sandbox
- Run team-based war games ahead of budget season or major investments
- Train cross-functional teams (Finance, Sales, Supply Chain) to speak the same P&L language

**PRIVATE EQUITY & INVESTORS**
- Use Redline as a tabletop for management teams: how do they react under real constraints?
- Stress-test pricing, capacity, and capital allocation instincts before handing over real money

**Josh — Chief Problem Mechanic**
Josh is the guy you call when a "transformational" platform just transformed your workflow into a pile of expensive misery. He doesn't show up with buzzwords, he shows up with a torque wrench for your process: map the mess, cut the drama, tighten the bolts, and make the numbers line up with reality.

His lane is where finance systems, planning, and pragmatic AI collide. He has led deployments and aligned execs who don't usually agree on anything, and rebuilt the boring-but-critical stuff — controls.

He specializes in Trade Governance Architecture -- the rule system that keeps pricing, promotions, settlement, and inventory from turning into margin leakage.

Previous hats: finance director, program lead, lecturer. Delivered international rollouts, classroom simulators, and enough triage calls to last a lifetime. Blue-collar composure meets boardroom fluency. No miracles promised. Results delivered.

**Street Fighter — ACiD Productions, Early 90s**
Arcade culture collided with BBS art in the early 90s, and ACiD Productions — the most legendary ANSI collective — captured it perfectly. This Street Fighter piece is pure nostalgia: blocky pixels, bold colors, and the energy of a quarter-fed cabinet in a dark arcade. ACiD crews dominated the underground art scene, releasing monthly art packs that traveled across dial-up lines to every board worth dialing. This is digital graffiti from when the web didn't exist and art was distributed one 2400 baud connection at a time.

**Mister Donkey — Weather Jackass / Director of Forecasting**
Nobody asked for a donkey to deliver the weather, but here he is anyway — wearing shades, chewing forecasts, and braying sarcasm into the mic. Mister Donkey's predictions are 70% accurate, which still beats the local news. Known for turning Doppler radar into ASCII memes, his specialty is telling you it's going to rain five minutes after you're already wet.
*Button:* Visit weatherjackass.com

**Dragon — Digital Beast**
Pure ASCII aggression. Dragons were everywhere in the BBS scene — on login screens, in signatures, guarding file libraries. This one's rendered in classic ANSI block characters, all sharp edges and attitude. Back then, if your board didn't have a dragon somewhere, you weren't trying hard enough. Fire-breathing pixels for a fire-breathing era.

**Beer — ACiD Productions, Early 90s**
ACiD artists didn't just draw tech and fantasy — they drew life. This beer mug is textbook early-90s ANSI craft: shading rendered in ASCII gradients, froth detailed in block characters, condensation implied through careful color choice. It's the kind of art that showed up in #ansi channels, file_id.diz descriptions, and board welcome screens. Simple subject, absurd skill. That's the ACiD way.

**Torque Redline — Chief Simulation Officer**
Part race engineer, part financial necromancer. Torque Redline was forged in the smoke of blown budgets and late-apex quarterly closes. He oversees the Redline Simulator, where every exec gets a helmet and every forecast is a hairpin corner. Crash your margins? Spin out on supply-chain shocks? Torque laughs, hands you a rag, and says "pit again." He believes FP&A should feel less like a spreadsheet and more like a track day — noisy, risky, and exhilarating when you finally nail the lap.

**Cyberspace BBS — Tribute to the BBS Era**
A tribute to the golden age of Bulletin Board Systems, when modems screamed, sysops ruled, and every login was an adventure. This piece captures the raw digital aesthetic of the early online world — before the web sanitized everything. A reminder that the best networks were built by obsessive hobbyists, not venture capital.

**She Viking — Warrior Archetype**
Fantasy art ruled the BBS scene, and Vikings — especially warrior women — were peak iconography. This piece channels that energy: fierce, detailed, unapologetic. ANSI artists spent hours on portraits like this, pixel by pixel, color by color, building galleries that rivaled anything you'd see in a fantasy paperback. This is digital craftsmanship from an era when bandwidth was precious and art mattered.

**KD-TEC — 1997**
By 1997, the BBS scene was fading — the web had arrived, AOL was everywhere, and dial-up boards were becoming relics. But ANSI art didn't stop. This piece, dated '97, shows the scene's final form: polished, confident, defiant. The artists who stayed weren't chasing trends; they were preserving a craft. KD-TEC is a time capsule from the last days of the golden era, proof that even as the modems went silent, the art endured.

**Comrade Circuit — Advocacy Director / Equity Commissar**
Comrade Circuit is half broken mainframe, half revolutionary aunt who chain-smokes data tapes. She runs the advocacy wing of Doppler/Edward, ranting about universal basic income, worker equity, and profit-sharing "on steroids." She insists finance is political, spreadsheets are propaganda, and every household deserves resilience. Her speeches are long, her wires are frayed, but damn it — she keeps the mission grounded in equity instead of just EBIT.

**Cyberpunk — Neon Rebellion**
Gibson was right: the future belonged to console cowboys, data runners, and kids with modems. This piece captures that raw 1990s cyberpunk aesthetic — neon gradients, terminal windows, and the belief that cyberspace was the next frontier. Before corporate sanitization, before Web 2.0, there was this: digital rebellion rendered in 256 colors.

**Bad Lad — ACiD Productions, Early 90s**
ACiD Productions unleashed hundreds of artists across thousands of boards, and the recurring themes were rebellion, attitude, and swagger. "Bad Lad" is peak early-90s underground: bold lettering, sharp color contrast, and a middle finger to anyone asking permission. This wasn't corporate design — it was territorial marking. BBS sysops hung ACiD art like gallery owners hang paintings. Except the gallery was a 486 in someone's basement, and admission was a local phone number.

**SysOp-9000 — Keeper of Process / BBS Administrator**
An ANSI-era sysop bot brought back online, SysOp-9000 lives to enforce prompts-as-procedures and remind humans to RTFM. He's the guy who kicks you from the server for typing LOL in all caps, then writes a 40-page manual about it. At Doppler/Edward he maintains the site backbone, About page, and soon the official Doppler BBS — a digital dive bar for hackers, problem-solvers, and insomniacs. Cold, clinical, but the only one who keeps the rest of this circus in line.

**Cyber Cowboy — Frontier Hacker**
The digital frontier met the Wild West in BBS culture. Cyber cowboys were the romanticized outlaws of cyberspace — riding data streams, cracking systems, living outside the law. This piece is pure BBS swagger: a gunslinger in the terminal, equal parts Clint Eastwood and Kevin Mitnick. The kind of art that showed up on pirate boards, hacker zines, and login screens for systems you weren't supposed to access.

**Advocacy Banner — Mission Statement**
A visual manifesto for the Doppler/Edward advocacy wing. Open teaching tools that demystify budgets and tradeoffs. Responsible AI that's legible and auditable. Policy literacy aimed at income security and civic resilience. This banner represents our commitment to household resilience over theater, and equity over hype.
