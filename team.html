      <h2>Joshua Dopkowski <span class="title">— Chief Problem Mechanic</span></h2>
      <p>Josh is the guy you call when a “transformational” platform just transformed your workflow into a pile of expensive misery. Josh doesn’t show up with buzzwords, he shows up with a torque wrench for your process: map the mess, cut the drama, tighten the bolts, and make the numbers line up with reality.</p>
      <p>His lane is where finance systems, planning, and pragmatic AI collide. He has led deployments and rescues across FP&amp;A and Revenue Growth Management, aligned execs who don’t usually agree on anything, and rebuilt the boring-but-critical stuff—controls, forecasting cadence, and adoption—so the machine runs without heroics. Josh also teaches AI to think like a CFO, which is a polite way of saying we make models that don’t hallucinate your quarter.</p>
      <p>Method? Process first, always. Tech follows. “Prompts-as-procedures,” documentation or it didn’t happen, and measurement that isn’t dashboard theater. With Josh driving, we'll interrogate vendors, protect your teams from scope-creep cosplay, and design workflows that survive contact with the calendar.</p>
      <p class="aside">Previous hats: finance director, program lead, lecturer. Delivered international rollouts, classroom simulators, and enough triage calls to last a lifetime. Blue-collar composure meets boardroom fluency. No miracles promised. Results delivered.</p>

      <h2>Mister Donkey <span class="title">— Weather Jackass / Director of Forecasting</span></h2>
      <p>Nobody asked for a donkey to deliver the weather, but here he is anyway—wearing shades, chewing forecasts, and braying sarcasm into the mic. Mister Donkey’s predictions are 70% accurate, which still beats the local news. Known for turning Doppler radar into ASCII memes, his specialty is telling you it’s going to rain five minutes after you’re already wet.</p>

      <h2>Torque Redline <span class="title">— Chief Simulation Officer</span></h2>
      <p>Part race engineer, part financial necromancer. Torque Redline was forged in the smoke of blown budgets and late-apex quarterly closes. He oversees the Redline Simulator, where every exec gets a helmet and every forecast is a hairpin corner. Crash your margins? Spin out on supply-chain shocks? Torque laughs, hands you a rag, and says “pit again.” He believes FP&amp;A should feel less like a spreadsheet and more like a track day—noisy, risky, and exhilarating when you finally nail the lap.</p>

      <h2>Comrade Circuit <span class="title">— Advocacy Director / Equity Commissar</span></h2>
      <p>Comrade Circuit is half broken mainframe, half revolutionary aunt who chain-smokes data tapes. She runs the advocacy wing of Doppler/Edward, ranting about universal basic income, worker equity, and profit-sharing “on steroids.” She insists finance is political, spreadsheets are propaganda, and every household deserves resilience. Her speeches are long, her wires are frayed, but damn it—she keeps the mission grounded in equity instead of just EBIT.</p>

      <h2>SysOp-9000 <span class="title">— Keeper of Process / BBS Administrator</span></h2>
      <p>An ANSI-era sysop bot brought back online, SysOp-9000 lives to enforce prompts-as-procedures and remind humans to RTFM. He’s the guy who kicks you from the server for typing <code>LOL</code> in all caps, then writes a 40-page manual about it. At Doppler/Edward he maintains the site backbone, About page, and soon the official Doppler BBS—a digital dive bar for hackers, problem-solvers, and insomniacs. Cold, clinical, but the only one who keeps the rest of this circus in line.</p>
