      <h2>Josh <span class="title">&mdash; Chief Problem Mechanic</span></h2>

      <p>Josh is the guy you call when a "transformational" platform just transformed your workflow into a pile of expensive misery. He doesn't show up with buzzwords, he shows up with a torque wrench for your process: map the mess, cut the drama, tighten the bolts, and make the numbers line up with reality.</p>

      <p>His lane is where finance systems, planning, and pragmatic AI collide. He has led deployments and aligned execs who don't usually agree on anything, and rebuilt the boring-but-critical stuff&mdash;controls. </p>

      <p>He specializes in Trade Governance Architecture -- the rule system that keeps pricing, promotions, settlement, and inventory from turning into margin leakage.</p>

      <p class="aside">Previous hats: finance director, program lead, lecturer. Delivered international rollouts, classroom simulators, and enough triage calls to last a lifetime. Blue-collar composure meets boardroom fluency. No miracles promised. Results delivered.</p>

      <h2>Street Fighter <span class="title">&mdash; ACiD Productions, Early 90s</span></h2>

      <p>Arcade culture collided with BBS art in the early 90s, and ACiD Productions&mdash;the most legendary ANSI collective&mdash;captured it perfectly. This Street Fighter piece is pure nostalgia: blocky pixels, bold colors, and the energy of a quarter-fed cabinet in a dark arcade. ACiD crews dominated the underground art scene, releasing monthly art packs that traveled across dial-up lines to every board worth dialing. This is digital graffiti from when the web didn't exist and art was distributed one 2400 baud connection at a time.</p>

      <p>Nobody asked for a donkey to deliver the weather, but here he is anyway&mdash;wearing shades, chewing forecasts, and braying sarcasm into the mic. Mister Donkey's predictions are 70% accurate, which still beats the local news. Known for turning Doppler radar into ASCII memes, his specialty is telling you it's going to rain five minutes after you're already wet.</p>

      <h2>Dragon <span class="title">&mdash; Digital Beast</span></h2>

      <p>Pure ASCII aggression. Dragons were everywhere in the BBS scene&mdash;on login screens, in signatures, guarding file libraries. This one's rendered in classic ANSI block characters, all sharp edges and attitude. Back then, if your board didn't have a dragon somewhere, you weren't trying hard enough. Fire-breathing pixels for a fire-breathing era.</p>

      <h2>Beer <span class="title">&mdash; ACiD Productions, Early 90s</span></h2>

      <p>ACiD artists didn't just draw tech and fantasy&mdash;they drew life. This beer mug is textbook early-90s ANSI craft: shading rendered in ASCII gradients, froth detailed in block characters, condensation implied through careful color choice. It's the kind of art that showed up in #ansi channels, file_id.diz descriptions, and board welcome screens. Simple subject, absurd skill. That's the ACiD way.</p>

      <p>Part race engineer, part financial necromancer. Torque Redline was forged in the smoke of blown budgets and late-apex quarterly closes. He oversees the Redline Simulator, where every exec gets a helmet and every forecast is a hairpin corner. Crash your margins? Spin out on supply-chain shocks? Torque laughs, hands you a rag, and says "pit again." He believes FP&amp;A should feel less like a spreadsheet and more like a track day&mdash;noisy, risky, and exhilarating when you finally nail the lap.</p>

      <h2>Cyberspace BBS <span class="title">&mdash; Tribute to the BBS Era</span></h2>

      <p>A tribute to the golden age of Bulletin Board Systems, when modems screamed, sysops ruled, and every login was an adventure. This piece captures the raw digital aesthetic of the early online world&mdash;before the web sanitized everything. A reminder that the best networks were built by obsessive hobbyists, not venture capital.</p>

      <h2>She Viking <span class="title">&mdash; Warrior Archetype</span></h2>

      <p>Fantasy art ruled the BBS scene, and Vikings&mdash;especially warrior women&mdash;were peak iconography. This piece channels that energy: fierce, detailed, unapologetic. ANSI artists spent hours on portraits like this, pixel by pixel, color by color, building galleries that rivaled anything you'd see in a fantasy paperback. This is digital craftsmanship from an era when bandwidth was precious and art mattered.</p>

      <h2>KD-TEC <span class="title">&mdash; 1997</span></h2>

      <p>By 1997, the BBS scene was fading&mdash;the web had arrived, AOL was everywhere, and dial-up boards were becoming relics. But ANSI art didn't stop. This piece, dated '97, shows the scene's final form: polished, confident, defiant. The artists who stayed weren't chasing trends; they were preserving a craft. KD-TEC is a time capsule from the last days of the golden era, proof that even as the modems went silent, the art endured.</p>

      <p>Comrade Circuit is half broken mainframe, half revolutionary aunt who chain-smokes data tapes. She runs the advocacy wing of Doppler/Edward, ranting about universal basic income, worker equity, and profit-sharing "on steroids." She insists finance is political, spreadsheets are propaganda, and every household deserves resilience. Her speeches are long, her wires are frayed, but damn it&mdash;she keeps the mission grounded in equity instead of just EBIT.</p>

      <p>Gibson was right: the future belonged to console cowboys, data runners, and kids with modems. This piece captures that raw 1990s cyberpunk aesthetic&mdash;neon gradients, terminal windows, and the belief that cyberspace was the next frontier. Before corporate sanitization, before Web 2.0, there was this: digital rebellion rendered in 256 colors.</p>

      <h2>Bad Lad <span class="title">&mdash; ACiD Productions, Early 90s</span></h2>

      <p>ACiD Productions unleashed hundreds of artists across thousands of boards, and the recurring themes were rebellion, attitude, and swagger. "Bad Lad" is peak early-90s underground: bold lettering, sharp color contrast, and a middle finger to anyone asking permission. This wasn't corporate design&mdash;it was territorial marking. BBS sysops hung ACiD art like gallery owners hang paintings. Except the gallery was a 486 in someone's basement, and admission was a local phone number.</p>

      <p>An ANSI-era sysop bot brought back online, SysOp-9000 lives to enforce prompts-as-procedures and remind humans to RTFM. He's the guy who kicks you from the server for typing <code>LOL</code> in all caps, then writes a 40-page manual about it. At Doppler/Edward he maintains the site backbone, About page, and soon the official Doppler BBS&mdash;a digital dive bar for hackers, problem-solvers, and insomniacs. Cold, clinical, but the only one who keeps the rest of this circus in line.</p>

      <h2>Cyber Cowboy <span class="title">&mdash; Frontier Hacker</span></h2>

      <p>The digital frontier met the Wild West in BBS culture. Cyber cowboys were the romanticized outlaws of cyberspace&mdash;riding data streams, cracking systems, living outside the law. This piece is pure BBS swagger: a gunslinger in the terminal, equal parts Clint Eastwood and Kevin Mitnick. The kind of art that showed up on pirate boards, hacker zines, and login screens for systems you weren't supposed to access.</p>
